----- Stretch Questions -----
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
 - A block element takes up 100% of the width available to it, and always starts on a new line.
 - An inline element does not start on a new line, and only takes up as much width as is necessary, based on its contents' width.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
 - An element that is position absolutely ignores all other elements on a page, and positions itself based on the top left corner. Setting top to 100px and left to 250px would literally place the element exactly 100px from the top, and its left side 250px from the left of the page.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
 - To do this, you could set the element to have a maximum width, and set its initial width to inherit. This will make the element size itself based on the width of its content, while also giving you an option to set a width you won't allow it to exceed.

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
 - Block: div, heading 1-6, and p.
 - Inline: a, img.
 - Inline Block: textarea.

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
 - The box model consists of the main content, the padding, margin, and the border of the box element.
 - The content is where the element we put inside will be visible on the page, wether it is text, an image, links, or even a form.
 - The padding is the area inside the box, but outside of the main content area.
 - The margin is spacing outside of the box. This makes it space itself away from other elements by the amount you set.
 - Border is the outside border of the box, outside of the padding, but inside the margin. This can be made to be any width.
 - Setting a default width of the box sets its initial width, however adding padding or border size to it makes this width change by that amount on both sides. Such as adding a 10px border, and 50px padding to a box of 150px actually increases its width to a total of 270px.
 - box-sizing was added to help with this. Setting its box-sizing property to border-box forces the box to include the border and padding in the overall width. Meaning a box 150px in width with a box-sizing property set to border-box, will remain 150px even if padding is made to be 50px, or it's given a border of 10px.
